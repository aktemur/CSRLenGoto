# CSRLenGoto method for SpMV

This is a clone of Merrill and Garland's
[Merge-based Parallel Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication](https://github.com/dumerrill/merge-spmv).
We integrated our **CSRLenGoto** method as the kernel (i.e. sequential) SpMV method to their code.

More information to come later...
